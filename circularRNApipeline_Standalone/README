** Before attempting to run, follow INSTALL directions to configure and test your installation.

** You must cd into circularRNApipeline_Standalone and run the script completeRun.sh
from within the directory so that all relative paths will work.

** There are a total of 10 possible parameters, the first 5 are required and
defaults for the rest are described in the main project README. Keep in mind that since this is a
shell script the arguments are positional. This means that if you wanted to use
default value for argument 6 but wanted to specify a different value for
parameter 7, you still need to call the script with the default value for
argument 6 specified.

** see README on main project page for details on each of these parameters

In addition to the values for the parameter "mode" documented in the main project README,
you can append "skipDenovo" to the mode string if you only want annotated junctions reported
and "skipR2" if you only want junctions reported based on R1 junctional alignments (as in the
initial KNIFE publication) instead of both R1 and R2 which is the default in the current version.

If running on single end reads, append "skipGLM" to the mode parameter since the glm requires PE data.
If you forget to append this value to the mode, you will see errors when the glm tries to run, but 
the output under /reports directory is valid and you can just ignore the glm errors since this is 
irrelevant for SE reads.
